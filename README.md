# A demo Duda widget with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Run `npm install` to start.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Make sure to deploy the entire `static` directory to later reference it from the Widgets Builder
